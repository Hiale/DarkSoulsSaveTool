Dark Souls Save Tool - Readme
=============================

As you know the progress in Dark Souls is valuable. Therefore I created this small tool.
It backups the Dark Souls Save file to a specific folder. DSfix by Durante also has backup
functionalities. However, I wanted to have them in a different location.

Dark Souls & Dark Souls 2
=========================
The tool is compatible with Dark Souls (1) and Dark Souls 2.

How to use it?
==============
Extract the application to folder and run DarkSoulsSaveTool.exe.
When you first start the application, it will try to determine your Save file and display
it in the window. In this case just select a target directory and you are ready to play and save
backups!
If you have more than one save files, you will have to manually select which one should be taken.
If you wish, you can change the Save and Restore Keys. Using these keys backups will be created
and restored (see below).
Press OK to close the dialog and the program will continue to run as a tray application (right near
the clock).
The next time the application is started, it will go to try straight away, but the settings can still be
changed by rightclicking on the tray symbol.

How can this tool be deleted?
=============================
There is a small bin symbol on the main window. Clicking on it, removes the Settings file created
by this tool. Afterwards you can delete the folder to where you have extracted this application.

Save (create Backups)
=====================
This tool does not create backups periodically like DSfix, instead you have to press the
Save-Key on your keyboard. So whenever this key is pressed, a copy of your current Save file is
created in the target folder. A Windows sound will be heard, so you can be sure that everything worked.
It is recommended to use 'Save' only on the Title screen, however in theory, it should work always.
In this case, a warning will appear when you try to load that save. But it should work anyway.

Restore (a backup)
==================
You can also restore the latest backup and continue your journey at that point however there
is an important note:
You can only restore Save files from within the Title Screen!
It is always restored the latest save. If you want to restore another save, you have to go to your
target directory and manually rename the appropriate file.
